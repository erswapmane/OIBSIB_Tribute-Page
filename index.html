          <p class="info">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (born Feb. 19, 1630, or April 1627, Shivner, Pune, Indiaâ€”died April 3, 1680, Rajgarh), Indian king (r. 1674â€“80), founder of the Maratha kingdom of India. A devout Hindu, he grew up at a time when India was ruled by Muslims, and he found their religious persecution intolerable. Collecting a band of followers, he began in c. 1655 to seize weak outposts of the sultan of Bijapur. In 1659 he lured the sultanâ€™s army to its destruction and, possessed of its horses and armaments, became overnight a formidable warlord. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb sent out his most prominent general and an army of 100,000 to capture him, but Shivaji made a daring escape. Gaining even more strength, he added a naval force to his military might. In 1674 he proclaimed himself an independent sovereign. He forged an alliance with the sultans in the south, thereby blocking the spread of Mughal rule. His rule was noted for its religious tolerance. See also Maratha confederacy.</p>

                <p>In 1674 during the summer,Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. The entire suppressed Hindu majority rallied to him as their great leader. He ruled his domain for almost six years through a cabinet of eight ministers. Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj who devout Hindu, who prided himself on the protector of his religion, broke the tradition by commanding that two of his relatives who had been forcibly converted to Islam should be taken back to Hinduism. 
    
                    Even though both the Christians, as well as the Muslims often kept on imposing their creeds on the population by force, he respected the beliefs and protected the religious places of both communities. Along with Hindus, many Muslims were also in his service. After his coronation, his most remarkable campaign was in the south. During this campaign, he allied with the Sultans and blocked the grand design of the Mughals to spread their rule over the entire subcontinent.</p>

                        By the 16th Century, The Deccan region of India came under the rule of the Mughal Empire established in Delhi. The uplands of Maratha were captured by the Adilshahi Sultanate on its north, a tributary state of the Mughal Emperor.  Shahaji Bhonsle was established as the chieftain of this region which belonged to the family of Bhonsle clan. Later, he became a rebel and started campaigns and raids against the Mughal Empire establishing forts. However, he was supported by the Bijapur government but was never successful. So he had to run from fort to fort with his Jijabai and son Shivaji. The condition in which Shivaji grew up made him a great king later. 
                        
                        
                        By 16, he had his band of fighters and continued the fight for Shahaji. In 1647, he took over the administration of Poona against the Bijapur government. This was a major step and led to conflict with Bijapur. Subsequently, in a concise period, he also captured the forts of Purandhara, Kondhana, and Chakan. Then Supa, Baramati, and Inderpuri came into control of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The loot gathered helped him to build a capital fort at Raigad. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is more famous for the new military tactics he formulated and used to fight his enemies in such terrains. This new method of gorilla tactics helped him to capture many forts within no time and brought a significant portion of the region under his control.
                        
                        
                        Bijapur government became conscious of his wins and imprisoned Shahaji in 1648. After his release in a year, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj stayed low and consolidated the region under his rule. In 1656 he again began his raids and campaigns and captured the valley of Javali near Mahabaleshwar. Additionally, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj successfully subdued many other families with Deshmukhi rights under Adilshah of Bijapur. 
                        
                        
                        In conclusion, Chhatrapati Shivaji's life was full of hostilities with the kingdoms surrounding the Maratha region and also allianced to fight the wars. Finally, he established the Kingdom of Maratha and is still remembered as a great king of India.</p>
